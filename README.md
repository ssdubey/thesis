# iitm-thesis-template

A LaTeX class (`iitmdiss.cls`) along with a simple template thesis
(`thesis.tex`) and synopsis (`synopsis.tex`) are provided here.  These can
be used to easily write a thesis (or synopsis) suitable for submission
at IIT Madras.  The class provides options to format PhD, MS,
M.Tech., B.Tech. and DD thesis.  It also allows one to write a synopsis
using the same class file.  Also provided is a BiBTeX style file
(`iitm.bst`) that formats all bibliography entries as per the IITM
format.  A simple sample bibliography file (`refs.bib`) is also
provided.

Please read thesis.dvi for more details.
