\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

We present \name, a novel programming model for developing loosely connected
distributed applications based on the principles of Git. We illustrate the
practicality of this approach by instantiating \name on Cassandra, an
off-the-shelf eventually consistent distributed store. Our experimental results
suggests that \name makes it easy to build complex distributed applications
without compromising performance.
